## Prework

> TLDR: Complete the items below under each section by the Friday before class starts!

In order to best prepare you for your time at The Iron Yard, we've put together the following for you to start reviewing. This shouldn't take you too long, but you should put all of your focus on it while you are working through it.

#### Your Workstation

First things first, one of the most important tools you will use is your workstation. Making sure it is properly set up is extremely important. This is the reason we do the install party. Here are some things you'll need to make sure you have.

- Macbook (Air or Pro Prefered)
- Clean up your machine. Make sure you are organized and ready to go for the first day of class.
- Make sure you always have your charging cable with you, including the extension cord that is provided.


#### Install Some Things

* [ ] Install a Text Editor - [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) are recommended.

#### Most Important Thing

Send your instructor an email that includes:

1. Your github username
2. Any topics you particularly enjoyed or struggled with from the prework
3. How you learn best and how you're feeling about the upcoming class.
  * Where would you like to be in 3 months? 12?
  * If there are problems you anticipate, this would be a good place to brainstorm how we might work around them.

This sort of reflection can be very valuable and we'll be encouraging it throughout the course.

It's highly encouraged to keep a blog so you
have a record of your progress, both for
yourself and employers. You need not share it
with your classmates and with us but it can
be a valuable way to receive community support.

If you haven't started a blog, now would be a
good time to do so!

#### Bonus

> The following are not required, but will help you better be prepared for the course.

* Read chapters 3 and 4 of [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
* Complete the `Hello World` Github Guide - [See it Here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* Practice your Code Typing Skilzzz - [Do that Here](https://typing.io/)
  * Seriously, typing syntax is very different than prose. Practice now can mean much more time focusing on *the meat* of an assignment later.
